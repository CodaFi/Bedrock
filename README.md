###*n.* any firm foundation or basis

At WWDC 2015, Apple announced their plans to open-source Swift. Specifically, the compiler and standard library. They will not, however, be open-sourcing Foundation, UIKit, or AppKit, which are written in Objective-C and are platform-specific.

Bedrock is an attempt at building a 100% Swift open source framework that covers some of the types that one might want out of Foundation, UIKit, and AppKit. (This isn't a UI framework, but will have some types that are more suited to UIKit than Foundation, such as Color.)
